#Yo Dawg  
I heard you like preparing before you talk, so I'm talking before you prepare, so you can be prepared when you prepare to talk.

#Caveats! 
Do you:  

* Have a mac?  
* Have no idea how to give a talk?  
* Have something to say (you do)  

!SLIDE
#Speaking is like any other skill.
### RTFM...or watch these
Scott Hanselman's [*The Art of Speaking*](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4128694/ft_speaker_1.zip "the art of speaking")

Bret Victor's [*Inventing on Principle*](http://vimeo.com/36579366 "inventing on principle")

######...Victor's talk is just a great example of a successful tech talk

#Setup  
###Here's mine
* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "markdown")  
"*Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.*"  
More powerful than plain text, easier to play with than html.
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2 "sublime")  
or your editor of choice
* [Marked](http://markedapp.com/ "marked")  
Gives you auto updating Markdown previews...go split screen with your editor. Very helpful for creating slides quickly.
* [Slidedown](https://github.com/nakajima/slidedown "slidedown")
Turns Markdown (.md) documents into html slideshows. Requires node package manager.

!SLIDE
#Helpful additions
* [GitHub Pages](http://help.github.com/pages/ "github pages")  
If you use the gh-pages branch instead of master for your talks repo, you can just run the slideshow directly off of github.
* [Optimal Layout](http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout/)  
Helps you quickly arrange windows side-by-side.

!SLIDE
#Workflow
* Open up Sublime Text and Marked side by side.
* Start writing...when you save you'll see the Marked preview update.
* Start each new slide with *!SLIDE*  
this is not valid Markdown, but is used by Slidedown to divide your file into seperate slides.
* Start each slide with a line that starts with *#*  
it'll be the page's header.

#Go forth and speak
We don't know all of the technology  
We don't know everyone's role  
   
But we will...__when you tell us__
